## 🌱 Development Philosophy
I believe software is a craft — something to be built with care, clarity, and intention.  
For me, code is not just about making things work, but making them *well-designed, maintainable, and meaningful in the real world*.  
I aim to build solutions that are both technically solid and genuinely useful.
